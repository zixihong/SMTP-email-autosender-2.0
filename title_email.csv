Personalized Ranking with Diversity (PRD) 151515https://github.com/guoguibing/librec [74] incorporates the diversity goal into RankSGD [146]@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%"
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation," which aims to recommend relevant items to users while ranking diverse items closely together as much as possible.



•

RecNet 161616https://github.com/baichuan/Neural_Bayesian_Personalized_Ranking and Diversity-Promoting RecNet (DP-RecNet) The original RecNet [147] is a generic learning-to-rank framework for implicit feedback. It designs a novel neural network to simultaneously learn representations of users and items in an embedded space and the users’ preferences without any contextual information. On top of RecNet@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%"
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation, a Diversity-Promoting RecNet [148] is proposed@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation," which explicitly adopts a Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based loss to regulate the diversity within the list of items recommended to each user during training.



•

Item-Diversity-based Collaborative Filtering (IDCF) [75] proposes a general variance regularization method for MF-based CF models to improve recommendation diversification. Under implicit feedback-based recommendations@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%"

Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation, the accuracy-oriented RS model and the diversity-oriented RS model.

Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation," all the parameter adjustment strategies strictly follow the corresponding original paper.


Performance Comparison. Empirical results are summarized in Tab.IX. We observe that although the two-stage paradigm could boost the recommendation performance@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%"
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation, its improvement is extremely limited. A possible cause is that separately handling relevance and diversity could not strike a reasonable balance between them. Besides@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation, neural-network-based algorithms (such as DP-RecNet and GCN-AccDiv) show relatively unsatisfactory performance due to the data sparsity. By contrast@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%
Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation, our APA+DiHarS method could consistently perform better than all newly added algorithms@N=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{u_{i}\in\mathcal{U}}\sum_{%
